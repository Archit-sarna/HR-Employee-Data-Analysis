# HR Employee Data Analysis Project

## Overview

The HR Employee Data Analysis Project is a comprehensive exploration and analysis of employee data using SQL and visualization in Power BI. This project focuses on understanding and deriving insights from human resources data, providing valuable information for HR management and decision-making.

## SQL Data Preparation and Analysis

In this project, we use SQL for data preparation and analysis. The SQL code provided performs the following steps:

1. **Database Creation**: Creates a database named "project" and sets it as the current database.

2. **Data Loading**: Loads HR employee data into the "hr" table.

3. **Data Cleaning**: Cleans the data by converting date formats and handling null values.

4. **Feature Engineering**: Adds an "age" column, calculates the age of employees, and prepares the data for analysis.

5. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Performs various SQL queries to analyze the data, including demographic statistics, department statistics, termination rates, and more.

## Power BI Visualization

For visualization and reporting, we recommend using Power BI. You can connect Power BI to your SQL database to create interactive dashboards and reports based on the analyzed data.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: The SQL code cleans and prepares the HR employee data for analysis, ensuring data integrity.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: The SQL queries provide detailed insights into the employee data, including demographics, termination rates, tenure, and more.

- **Visualization with Power BI**: Leverage the power of Power BI to create interactive and informative visualizations, enabling easy data exploration and decision-making.

## Analysis Description

The SQL analysis in this project covers various aspects of HR data, including employee demographics, age distribution, termination rates, department-wise statistics, job titles, and more. The analysis is designed to provide HR professionals and decision-makers with a clear understanding of their workforce and valuable insights for strategic planning.

## Visualization

Power BI allows you to create visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, and tables. You can visualize data on employee demographics, termination rates, department statistics, job titles, location analysis, and more. These visualizations help in understanding trends, identifying patterns, and making data-driven decisions.

Please note that Power BI reports should be created separately based on the analyzed data. The SQL code provided serves as a data preparation step.

Feel free to customize and expand the analysis and visualization in Power BI based on your specific HR data and business needs.
